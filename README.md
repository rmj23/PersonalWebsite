# Personal Website
Welcome! This is the git repository for my personal website. I created it using the MVC structure and .NET Core 3. 
Currently this is website is being hosting on my webserver that I created using an AWS EC2 instance from scratch.
This webserver is operated by Windows Server 2019 and configured to host thousands of websites.
